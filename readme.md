Welcome to solar SIM gonna build a simulation of the solarsystemwith.net just to demonstrate some properties. Meaning to put some stuff out there open source for awhile seems like this might be a good place to open up a application put some parameters out there show how to connect it via MCP so that an LLM can access it. Gonna look at doing a real time simulation so who knows what this will turn into gonna start out very crude with just planetary orbit numbers. Let me know what you think.

hopefully this inspires some folks to....o sharpening my C sharp skills.
